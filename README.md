# TDD-cpp
Exanoles of TDD (Test-Driven Development) in C++

### Reasons:
This is mostly to test myself with the C++ development enviroment iwthout an IDE:
* To understand Makefiles, and TDD techniques.
* To understand better the C++ programming language.

The end result is not expected to be extravegant, just helpful.

### Compiling:

To run tests run:

```bash
make test
```

```make clean``` does what it should.

To make without compiling the tests run the following:
```bash
make [build]
```
